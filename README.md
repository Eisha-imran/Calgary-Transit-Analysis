# Calgary-Transit-Analysis
This uncover insights that will be useful for Calgary Transit in optimizing its services and improving Calgary's overall connectivity. 

### Introduction

Public transport is essential for getting around in cities, offering an affordable and sustainable alternative to individual automobiles. In a city that is expanding quickly like Calgary, understanding transit patterns such as route popularity, stop locations, and trip efficiency - is crucial for optimizing service quality and satisfying the community's requirements. The objective of our project is to explore Calgaryâ€™s transit scheduling data through a thorough inspection of routes, trips, stops, and stop times. We will focus on transit density, route types, popular destinations, and service types to find patterns to help direct data-driven improvements to the transit system.

Our analysis will tackle questions about operational effectiveness and transit demand. We will determine the busiest routes, comprehending stop coverage for important locations like schools and hospitals. We will also evaluate the relationship between time and distance travelled. The overarching goal of this analysis is to uncover insights that will be useful for Calgary Transit in optimizing its services and improving Calgary's overall connectivity. The results may serve as the foundation for future projects to improve Calgary's accessibility and urban transit system.



To explore the selected datasets we have come up with the following research questions. More details about the datasets is provided in the next section.
