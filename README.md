# Calgary-Transit-Analysis
This uncover insights that will be useful for Calgary Transit in optimizing its services and improving Calgary's overall connectivity. 

### Introduction

Public transport is essential for getting around in cities, offering an affordable and sustainable alternative to individual automobiles. In a city that is expanding quickly like Calgary, understanding transit patterns such as route popularity, stop locations, and trip efficiency - is crucial for optimizing service quality and satisfying the community's requirements. The objective of our project is to explore Calgary’s transit scheduling data through a thorough inspection of routes, trips, stops, and stop times. We will focus on transit density, route types, popular destinations, and service types to find patterns to help direct data-driven improvements to the transit system.

Our analysis will tackle questions about operational effectiveness and transit demand. We will determine the busiest routes, comprehending stop coverage for important locations like schools and hospitals. We will also evaluate the relationship between time and distance travelled. The overarching goal of this analysis is to uncover insights that will be useful for Calgary Transit in optimizing its services and improving Calgary's overall connectivity. The results may serve as the foundation for future projects to improve Calgary's accessibility and urban transit system.



To explore the selected datasets we have come up with the following research questions. More details about the datasets is provided in the next section.

1- How many routes are in the Calgary Transit system?

2- What are the different transit route types available (bus, ferry, train etc)? How are they distributed?

3- How many routes service multiple neighbourhoods (e.g. Huntington — Sunridge) and how many stay within a neighbourhood (e.g. Evanston)?

4- Which areas have more bus routes and which areas are underserved?

5- What are the trip distances and travel times of express routes (highways, airports, etc) compared to local routes?

6- What are the most popular routes on Calgary Transit?

7- How do the direction of a trip and destination impact bus trips?

8- Which day of the week is the busiest for Calgary Transit, and what are the diffirences between weekday and weekend use?

9- How many transit stops are there specifically for schools and hospitals in Calgary?

10- What is the average distance between consecutive stops?

11- What are the best 10 stops nearest to the given location(considering University of Calgary)?

12- Find the 10 stops with highest number of stops and with the highest duration

13- What is the shortest and longest trips?

14- What is the total distance travelled for each trip?

15- How does the total distance travelled for each trip compare to the total travel time?
